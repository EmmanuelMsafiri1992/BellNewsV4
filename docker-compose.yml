# docker-compose.yml
# This file defines the multi-service Docker application for your Ubuntu Mini PC.
# It includes the main Python web app, the Laravel news app,
# and the Ubuntu configuration service (with host network control).

# Docker Compose file format version.
version: '3.8'

services:
  # Main Python Flask web application (bellapp)
  pythonapp:
    build: ./bellapp # Specifies the build context for the Python app
    # When running on the Ubuntu host, this maps to the host's port 5000
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    restart: always
    container_name: bellapp
    volumes:
      # Mount the logs directory from the host to the container for persistence and access
      - ./bellapp/logs:/bellapp/logs
    depends_on:
      - config_service # Ensures config_service starts before pythonapp
    environment:
      # When running on the same Ubuntu host, config_service is accessible via localhost
      UBUNTU_CONFIG_SERVICE_URL: http://localhost:5002

  # Laravel news application
  laravelapp:
    build: ./newsapp
    environment:
      # VITE_API_BASE_URL points to the pythonapp service within the Docker network
      - VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://pythonapp:5000

  # Ubuntu Configuration Service (runs with host network access on Ubuntu Mini PC)
  config_service:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile_config
    # IMPORTANT: network_mode: host allows the container to directly access the host's network stack.
    # This is required for 'netplan apply' to work on the host.
    # When using network_mode: host, the 'ports' mapping is not needed as the container
    # directly uses the host's network interfaces and ports.
    network_mode: "host"
    restart: always
    container_name: config_service
    volumes:
      # Mount the host's /etc/netplan directory into the container.
      # This allows the service to read and write Netplan configuration files on the host.
      - /etc/netplan:/etc/netplan
      # Mount the log directory for the config service
      - ./config_service_logs:/var/log
    # IMPORTANT: privileged mode gives the container extensive capabilities, including
    # modifying network interfaces. This is required for 'netplan apply' to function.
    # USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION IN PRODUCTION.
    privileged: true
    # Removed the empty 'environment:' block that was causing the schema error.
